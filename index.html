                            My name is Jacquelyne Mido Glover. I go by Jack for short. I was born in Frankfurt, Germany to a military family with strong values of open mindedness, hard work, loyalty, patriotism and adaptation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I want to get my foot in the door in the growing tech industry as a JavaScript developer, creating functional code for web apps.
                        </p>
                            I am an artist and a writer. I live for the thrill of producing something from nothing. There is no more magical feeling in the world than to create.
                        <p>    
                            The University of Colorado at Boulder is my Alma mater. There I graduated as a <i>summa cum laude</i> with a Bachelorâ€™s of Arts in English.
                        </p>
                        <p>    
                            I've worked as a staff writer at Metrosphere Magazine where my focus was on art and art events in the Denver Metro area. I researched different artists and movements, wrote articles, and worked with a team to edit and revise articles into a final draft by the publication deadline. I also worked as the program coordinator for a non-profit teen mentorship program in Idaho Springs called the Clear Creek Rock House. My work at the Rock House was almost entirely self-directed: I had the goal of producing a mentorship program that utilized best practices to enrich the lives of underprivileged teens.
                        </p>
                        <p>    
                            Currently I am a student at the University of Denver Coding Boot Camp. I have learned HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery. I have also learned how to write ajax requests, use gitHub, integrate APIs, utilize frameworks like Bootstrap and Materialize, and use node.js. In the coming weeks I will learn ReactJS, Angular, MySQL, and MongoDB.
